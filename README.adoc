= open transport libssh2 port

This is a project to port libssh2 to the Retro68 toolchain for m68k and PPC Macs running an Open Transport networking stack.

My goal is to write a new SSH client (named ssheven) for system 7/8/9.

TODO:

* [*] basic build stuff
* [*] get all required mbedtls functionality working (filesystem stuff for key loading etc.?)
* [*] replace/implement socket ops

It currently works, but has only been tested in blocking mode, and the error handling needs improvement.

== notes
first build and install my opentransport-mbedtls library port.

cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/your/path/to/Retro68-build/toolchain/powerpc-apple-macos/cmake/retroppc.toolchain.cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCRYPTO_BACKEND=mbedTLS -DENABLE_ZLIB_COMPRESSION=OFF -DENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF

and then just make install.
